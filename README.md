# Villager Reset Plugin (Tested Version 1.20.4)
Minecraft Force Job Reset for Villager

In Minecraft, when you right-click on the villagers who are given a profession and start trading, even if you break the block you give the profession, the villager does not leave the profession, so with this plugin I specially created, I brought the possibility of forced reset for minecraft villagers who do not reset the profession.

# Usage
Look at the peasant whose profession has not been reset and apply the Shift + Right Click combination. The villagers will return to normal.

Or use the /villager reset command.

# Minecraft Server Version

**The version I tested and got healthy results is version 1.20.4, I don't know about the suitability of other versions because I haven't tried other versions.

Plugin continues to be developed.**
